This project is a simple yet efficient work management web application designed for my workplace as a LPG station Manager. 
It streamlines daily operations by enabling users to easily create and manage accounts, track inventory, and monitor transactions in real time. 
Built with Streamlit, the application offers an intuitive interface for station operators to manage resources and maintain accurate records with minimal effort.
